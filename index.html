          My name is Hedda Olimb, I am 21 years old, and I come from Hadeland,
          Jevnaker. I am studying Bachelor in Web Development at NTNU in Gj√∏vik,
          and I think it is exciting and fun. <br>My biggest hobby is dogs as I have
          five dogs myself. Apart from that, I like to draw, be with friends,
          play piano and watch comics. <br>I would also consider myself a film
          critic and film enthusiast, as well as a food enthusiast. This page is
          for my Front-End exam.
